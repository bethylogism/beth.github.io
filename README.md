# beth.sh

This is my woefully outdated personal portfolio website [beth.sh](https://beth.sh). I have Big Plans for this, one day. For now, I enjoy that it's simple HTML. The correct tool for the job.

## Run locally

install deps e.g. `pnpm i`

Open in browser:

`open index.html`

Do not edit styles.css directly. Instead, use Sass (because ♥ nesting) and run:

`pnpm sass --watch style.scss:style.css`

Et voilà... C'est tout.
