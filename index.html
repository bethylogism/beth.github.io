              I like solving problems and learning new things. Philosopy at Cambridge taught me logic. Neuroscience at UCL taught me statistical functions. Software development at General Assembly taught me that I was born to code.

            Project 1: ‘Mastermind’ - A grid-based game (1 week)  JavaScript | CSS | HTML
            This was an independent project. I coded a code-breaking game called Mastermind in JavaScript, which involved comparing two arrays and feeding back two types of clue depending on whether a player’s guesses are included in or identical to elements in a second array.

            Project 2: ‘Eventify’ - RESTful events app (1 day Hackathon)  React | JavaScript | HTML | CSS
              Worked in a group of two to create a React App in a day. Targeting people looking for something to do, we mashed up the Skiddle events API and the mapbox GL API to create a simple map-based app that tells users what is happening around them on that day. Completed through a combination of pair-coding and allocating independent tasks with Trello.

            Project 3: ‘Created.com’ - A full-stack React app (1 week)   React | Node | MongoDB | Express
            In this group project we designed a full-stack React/Express app with a NoSQL database. In our app, ‘Created’, registered users can upload listings of furniture or art which they have made themselves, can comment, and can email other members. We managed our time with a Trello Kanban board, merged features to development branch very regularly, and closely discussed all git merge conflicts.

            Project 4: ‘Sunset Barlevard’ - A Full-stack React/SQL app for finding barcrawls (1 week)   Python | React | PostgreSQL | Flask | Marshmallow |  SQLAlchemy
            Small group project with a SQL database back-end (written in Python) and a React front-end. Biggest challenges were the many-to-many relationships between models, and implementing an associated object to include the additional relationship of order within a crawls-bars join table. Biggest win was integrating mapbox routes, effective use of React components. and having a great time.
